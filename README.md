Hello my fellow sepians.

I've been coding for awhile but you could still call me a Noob.
I started off learning basic programming concepts with c++, but 
now I'm a python fanatic considering all of the functionality 
you can get out of this one language.

I wanted to do something special for my first project on GitHub. I've
always been interested in AI and hollywood renditions of it such as 
Jarvis, R2D2, and other personal assistant robots. So I've decided 
to code a fully functional personal assistant.

This python based personal assistant will be able to recognize speech as well
as use Google's speech recognition services to interact with any user.
I will also be planning on creating a facial recognition feature to make 
the user experience much more realistic.

Sqlite will also be intergrated to handle specific user information, such as names
and down the road images, texts and emails. Huge project for my first github repo
but you know what they say, go big or go HOME. Thanks for reading and stay tuned!

Personal Assistant. Chatbot. First repo!
